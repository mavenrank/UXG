                    <h3>Design Thinking : UX</h3>A <b>Framework</b> is a
                    conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best practises
                    and processes for solving problems and building the
                    solutions for solving real world problems.
                    <br />
                    It is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that
                    includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing
                    to help you understand who your user is, what their problems
                    are, and what your design should include.
                    <br />
                    It is a iterative process where you repeat certain steps to
                    refine your design. The Framework follows these five steps.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Empathize</b> <br />
                                Leanr more about the user's problems, wants &
                                needs and the environemnt in which they'll
                                experience your design. Step away from your
                                assumptions and guesses and let research inform
                                you about your decision-making. The research you
                                do will be in the form of surveys, interviews
                                and observation sessions but also conduct
                                research about the competitor's product and how
                                people integrate the product in their life.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Define</b>
                                <br />
                                Analyze the research findings and find out which
                                of the user problems are the most important to
                                solve. You might also develop a value
                                proposition that is a summary of why a customer
                                would / should use the product you are designing.
