                    <h3>Design Thinking : UX</h3>A <b>Framework</b> is a
                    conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best practises
                    and processes for solving problems and building the
                    solutions for solving real world problems.
                    <br />
                    It is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that
                    includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing
                    to help you understand who your user is, what their problems
                    are, and what your design should include.
                    <br />
                    It is a iterative process where you repeat certain steps to
                    refine your design. The Framework follows these five steps.

                                experience your design. Step away from your
                                assumptions and guesses and let research inform
                                you about your decision-making. The research you
                                do will be in the form of surveys, interviews
                                and observation sessions but also conduct
                                research about the competitor's product and how
                                people integrate the product in their life.

                                            interviews. Designers can then plan
                                            interviews that achieve the best
                                            balance between their information

                                            when designers need to brainstorm
                                            the visual elements of the design.

                                            Now, designers will take one of the
                                            HMW statements and apply the
                                            following:

                                                        Divide a large sheet of

                                <b>Prototype</b> phase is where the goal is to
                                produce a product that demonstrates its
                                functionality and can be used for testing.
                                <b>Testing</b> phase is critical in developing
                                the right solution to address user's problem and
                                an organized approach of testing can help you
                                create exceptional user experiences. Both these
                                stages are interconnected and you will test each
                                prototype you make. Take as much feedback of ech
                                change that you make from the client. If you
                                make a too polished version then you might not
                                get as much as a reaction and feedback
