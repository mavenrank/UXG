                                    There's a lot to learn about the customer
                                    and their preferences, and UX Designers want
                                    to learn as much as possible to inform their
                                    product design.

                                    Wireframing is an outline or sketch of a
                                    product or a screen. It helps us figure out
                                    how each element is arranged and each piece
                                    interacts. It is done after or at the same
                                    time as research.

                                    illustrates progression from one screen to
                                    the next.

                            The purpose of wireframes and protoypes is to figure
