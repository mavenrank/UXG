                    It is the process used to take a product from an idea to a
                    reality.

                                    UX Researchers and Writers are often heavily
                                    involved in this stage to conduct interviews
                                    with the clients or confuct other research.

                                    <b>Define</b> <br />
                                    Who the product is for, what the product
                                    will do and what features are to be included
                                    for the product to be successful.

                                    <b>Design</b> <br />
                                    Actively develop ideas and check that all
                                    the specifications from the first two stages
                                    are realstic

                                    This is a stage that involves lots of
                                    interaction between UX designers and
                                    front-end engineers as they figure out ways
                                    to create an end product that satisfies
                                    users' needs and is practical and
                                    functional.

                                    The last stage of the product development
                                    lifecycle is launch or sharing a finished
                                    version of the product with the public
                                </p>

                        The first two stages are more about preparation and
                        planning. Using the insights from the first two stages,
                        UX designers generate designs.
                        <br />
                        You'll create many different assets, including
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>storyboards</b>, which are sketches that
                                    help explore the user's experience
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    or <b>wireframes</b>, which provide outlines
                                    of the content layout
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    you might create <b>prototypes</b>, which
                                    are models that allow UX designers to test
                                    the functionality of a design
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        Testing designs with users is really important because
                        it helps the team focus on the user first and foremost
                        and the designs second. Testing helps identify areas to
                        refine or improve the designs.
