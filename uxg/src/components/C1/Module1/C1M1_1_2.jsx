                    <h3>Product Development Lifecycle</h3> <br />
                    It is the process used to take a product from an idea to a
                    reality.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Brainstorm</b> <br />
                                Generating ideas about the user and the needs
                                and challenges the user might have <br />
                                UX Researchers and Writers are often heavily
                                involved in this stage to conduct interviews
                                with the clients or confuct other research.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Define</b> <br />
                                Who the product is for, what the product will do
                                and what features are to be included for the
                                product to be successful.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Design</b> <br />
                                Actively develop ideas and check that all the
                                specifications from the first two stages are
                                realstic
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Test</b> <br />
                                Evaluate priduct designs based on the feedback
                                of potential users. <br />
                                This is a stage that involves lots of
                                interaction between UX designers and front-end
                                engineers as they figure out ways to create an
                                end product that satisfies users' needs and is
                                practical and functional.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Launch</b> <br />
                                The last stage of the product development
                                lifecycle is launch or sharing a finished
                                version of the product with the public
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The first two stages are more about preparation and
                    planning. Using the insights from the first two stages, UX
                    designers generate designs. You'll create many different
                    assets, including
                    <li>
                        storyboards, which are sketches that help explore the
                        user's experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        or wireframes, which provide outlines of the content
                        layout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        you might create prototypes, which are models that allow
                        UX designers to test the functionality of a design
                    </li>
                    Testing designs with users is really important because it
                    helps the team focus on the user first and foremost and the
                    designs second. Testing helps identify areas to refine or
                    improve the designs.
