                    Product Development Lifecycle <br />
                    It is the process used to take a product from an idea to a
                    reality.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Brainstorm <br />
                            Generating ideas about the user and the needs and
                            challenges the user might have <br />
                            UX Researchers and Writers are often heavily
                            involved in this stage to conduct interviews with
                            the clients or confuct other research.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Define <br />
                            Who the product is for, what the product will do and
                            what features are to be included for the product to
                            be successful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Design <br />
                            Actively develop ideas and check that all the
                            specifications from the first two stages are
                            realstic
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Test <br />
                            Evaluate priduct designs based on the feedback of
                            potential users. <br />
                            This is a stage that involves lots of interaction
                            between UX designers and front-end engineers as they
                            figure out ways to create an end product that
                            satisfies users' needs and is practical and
                            functional.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Test <br />
                            The last stage of the product development lifecycle is
                            launch or sharing a finished version of the product
                            with the public
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The first two stages are more about preparation and
                    planning. Using the insights from the first two stages, UX
                    designers generate designs. You'll create many different
                    assets, including
                    <li>
                        storyboards, which are sketches that help explore the
                        user's experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        or wireframes, which provide outlines of the content
                        layout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        you might create prototypes, which are models that allow
                        UX designers to test the functionality of a design
                    </li>
                    Testing designs with users is really important because it
                    helps the team focus on the user first and foremost and the
                    designs second. Testing helps identify areas to refine or
                    improve the designs.
