                        <li>
                            Interaction Designers <br /> focus on designing the
                            experience of the product an how it functions, they
                            figure out how to connect the user's needs with the
                            businesses' goals with what's actually feasible to
                            build
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Visual Designers <br /> focus on designing how a
                            product or technology feels or looks, they are
                            responsible for font color, size, logos, iconography
                            and product layouts
                        </li>

                            Motion Designers <br /> think about what it feels
                            like for a user to move through a product and how to
                            create smooth transitions between pages for an app
                            or website

                    Similar to UX Designers, there are graphic designers. They
                    create visuals that tell a story or message. They ususally
                    work on the appearance of a physical product whereas UX
                    designers deal with how users interact with a product Roles

                            conduct studies and interviews to help us understand

                            think about how to make the language within a

                            Production Designers <br />
                            Often act as a bridge between Interaction Designers
                            and Engineers <br />
                            They make sure that the First and Final designs
                            match the finished product materials and that the
                            assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering
