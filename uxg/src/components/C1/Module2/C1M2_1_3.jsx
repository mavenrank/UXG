                    <h3>How users engage with different platforms?</h3>
                    An average desktop session is over twice as long as a mobile
                    session. But the mobile traffic has been higher than desktop
                    traffic for quite a while. People use different devies in
                    different ways. Almsot all of the wbsites today use
                    Responsive web design allowing the website to change
                    automatically depending upon the size of the device.
                    Following are best practises when building a mobile design.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Call to action buttons should be placed front
                                and center.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Navigation menus should be short and simple.
                                Menu functions should only highlight the core of
                                the product.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Use gestures that users already use like tapping
                                and swiping.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Design for both directions a phone might be
                                held. We need to consider both Vertical portrait
                                view and also the horizontal landscape view.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Reduce visual Clutter as mobile phones ahve
                                smaller screens and real estate. It's important
                                to keep the visual experience simple.
