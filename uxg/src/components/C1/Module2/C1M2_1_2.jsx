                    <b>Different Platforms</b> <br />
                    Platforms are the medium that users experience your product
                    on. Nowadays you need to make sure that your product is
                    cross-platform and supports all kins of devices like
                    Desktop, Laptop, Mobile Phone, SmartWatch etc. It is still
                    recommended to think about one platform first when you build
                    a new product and improve it to support various other
                    platforms.
                    <br />
                    In addition to having consistent user experience across all
                    platforms it is also necessary that you have a consistent
                    brand identity.

                    <b>Brand Identity</b> <br />
                    It refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company.
                    Every component must feel the same across all the platforms
                    and have consistent branding so that the different versions
                    are alike.
                    <br />
                    It is also important to understand that some functionalities
                    only exist in some platforms.
