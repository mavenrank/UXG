                    <h3>User</h3>
                    <h4>User Centric Design</h4>
                    User centric design is important as :
                    <li>user buys and uses your product </li>
                    <li>
                        solve real world problems that people actually
                        experience reduces designer bias
                    </li>
                    User Centric Design process has four steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Understand</b> <br />
                                Understand how the user experiences the product
                                and this requires a lot of research.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Specify</b>
                                <br />
                                Specify the end user needs. Based on your
                                research you will narrow down which end user
                                problem is the most important to solve.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Design Solutions</b>
                                <br />
                                This is where you actually solve the end user
                                issues and work upon the product and start
                                building it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Evaluate</b>
                                <br />
                                Evaluate your design against the end user needs.
                                Check if the design actually solves the problem
                                that was affecting the end users. Testing you
                                product with real people is also important.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    It is important to keep in mind as you are going through
                    this process, iteration is key. It is the process of doing
                    something again, but making tweaks to make it better.
