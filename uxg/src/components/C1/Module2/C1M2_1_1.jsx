                                <br />
                                Creating one product for users with the widest
                                range of abilities andin the widest range of
                                situations.
                                <br />
                                This is like a One-Size Fits All approach.
                                <br />
                                The problem with this is that the Design loses
                                its effectiveness. It becomes hard to acheive
                                any goals when you have you many intended users.
                                Even tough the design had the intention of being
                                inclusive, it still excluded a lot of people.

                                Inclusive design takes into account personal
                                identifiers like
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ability</li>
                                    <li>Race</li>
                                    <li>Economic Status</li>
                                    <li>Language</li>
                                    <li>Age</li>
                                    <li>Gender</li>
                                </ul>
                                Inclusive Design includes Researchers and
                                Designers from traditionally excluded
                                populations in the process, so they can provide
                                their unique perspectives during all phases of
                                the design process.

                                It is like "Solve for one, extend to many" type
                                of process. It focuses on Accessibility. <br />
                                But this approach of Solve for one, extend to
                                manny still has an issue, as it only focuses on
                                the group it was designed for and existing
                                users. Many groups are still left out.

                                <br />
                                This way of design takes Inclusive design even
                                further and it designs for groups that have been
                                historically underrepresentated or ignored.
                                <br />
                                This boils down to the difference between
                                Equality and Equity.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Equality is providing the{" "}

                                This is newer concept of design.

                                Start by building the product and think about
                                those groups who may not have used such a
                                product. Keep building your design keeping the
                                groups you identified as underrepresented front
                                and centre.

                    <h3>
                        How does Equity focused design affect races and gender?
                    </h3>
                    Job applications and Census forms are one area when gender
                    and race need specific attention. Because they usually
                    invlive collecting sensitive data form users. Think about if
                    the data you are collecting is really needed or can be
                    omitted. Also if there is a gender data being collected, it
                    is imporant to have multiple options so that the form is
                    inclusive to all genders. Race and accents also play a huge
                    role in the same way.
