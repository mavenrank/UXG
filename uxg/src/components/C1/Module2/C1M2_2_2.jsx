                                It talks about the systems and products that
                                enhance the learning, working and usability of a
                                given product for people with disabilities.

                                            Increases the contrast between
                                            background and text. High contrast
                                            makes the interface easier to se for
                                            people with low vision. Color
                                            Modification also helps people who
                                            may have eye strain or also

                                            <br />
                                            Screen readers are the most common
                                            assistive technologies for people
                                            with limited vision. The software
                                            works across platforms and reads any
                                            on-screen text. They also read
                                            interactive elements like button
                                            names, non-visible text etc.

                                            <br />
                                            Alt text helps us translate a visual
                                            user interface into a text based
                                            interface. It essentially uses any words to describe any meaningful image.
